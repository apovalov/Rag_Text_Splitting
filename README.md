- Level 1: Character Splitting - Simple static character chunks of data
- Level 2: Recursive Character Text Splitting - Recursive chunking based on a list of separators
- Level 3: Document Specific Splitting - Various chunking methods for different document types (PDF, Python, Markdown)
- Level 4: Semantic Splitting - Embedding walk based chunking
